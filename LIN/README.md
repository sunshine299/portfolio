### LIN Data Processing
- **Description**: This Python code is designed to process **LIN communication data** between the master and slave in a vehicle environment, particularly for **climatic conditioning applications**. The project focuses on three key types of data:
  1. **Master and Slave Data**: Extracts and merges data from each time frame, eliminating gaps and simplifying the processing procedure.
  2. **Diagnostics Data**: Processes diagnostics data, converting it from **hexadecimal** to **decimal**, and applies any necessary conversion formulas for accurate analysis.
  3. **Data Consolidation**: Produces a **consolidated CSV file** that allows for easier data processing in environments like **Excel**, and enables the creation of visual plots to analyze the behavior inside the vehicle environment.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Data Merging**: Merges **master and slave data** from different time frames to remove spaces and simplify data analysis.
  - **Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion**: Converts **hexadecimal data** in diagnostics into **decimal format**, with optional conversion formulas for certain values.
  - **CSV File Output**: Generates a **consolidated CSV file** that is compatible with tools like **Excel**, facilitating further analysis.
  - **Data Visualization**: Allows for **plotting** the processed data to analyze the behavior of climatic conditions inside the vehicle.

- **Skills/Technologies Used**:
  - **Programming Language**: Python for data processing and analysis.
  - **Libraries**: 
    - **Pandas** for efficient data manipulation and CSV generation.
    - **NumPy** for numerical data processing.
    - **Matplotlib** for generating visual plots of the processed data.
  - **File Formats**: Works with **CSV files** for data storage and compatibility with other tools.
