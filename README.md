This is a Python code to process LIN communication data between master and slave in vehicle environment for climatic conditioning applications. The code processes master, slave, and diagnostics data. For master and slave data, the objective is to extract and merge data from each time frame to eliminate spaces and simplify the processing procedure. Additionally, for diagnostics data, besides processing the data, it is necessary to convert data from hexadecimal to decimal and apply conversion formula if needed. Finally, the aim is to produce a consolidated CSV file to process the data in different environments, e.g., Excel, and produce plots to analyze the behavior inside the vehicle environment.
