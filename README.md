## Projects Overview

### 'Graph Maker' App
- **Description**: Developed of an application for streamlined **data acquisition** and **signal visualization**. The app features an easy-to-use graphical interface and is capable of processing and visualizing complex signal data efficiently. Users can interact with the app to explore trends and patterns within their data.

- **Key Features**:
  - **CSV File Upload**: Users can load a **CSV file** containing the data they want to visualize, which is then parsed for further processing.
  - **Signal Selection**: After loading the data, users can choose signals from **dropdown menus** to specify the data they want to visualize.
  - **Checkboxes**: Allows users to filter or mark specific datasets for more customized visualizations.
  - **Axis and Label Customization**: Users can **insert values for axes and labels** to personalize the graph’s appearance.
  - **Graph Plotting**: Once selections are made, the app plots the graph using **Matplotlib**, based on user input.
  - **User Input**: The app includes a **textbox** for users to insert their observations or notes related to the visualized data.
  

- **Skills/Technologies Used**:
  - **Graphical Interface**: Built using Python’s **Tkinter** library, compatible with both **Windows** and **MacOS**.
  - **Data Processing**: Utilizes **Pandas** and **NumPy** for efficient data handling and signal analysis.
  - **Data Visualization**: Displays data trends and patterns with **Matplotlib** creating interactive plots.
  - - **User Input**: Includes dropdowns, checkboxes, and input fields to make the app highly interactive and customizable.

### LIN Data Processing
- **Description**: This Python code is designed to process **LIN communication data** between the master and slave in a vehicle environment, particularly for **climatic conditioning applications**. The project focuses on three key types of data:
  1. **Master and Slave Data**: Extracts and merges data from each time frame, eliminating gaps and simplifying the processing procedure.
  2. **Diagnostics Data**: Processes diagnostics data, converting it from **hexadecimal** to **decimal**, and applies any necessary conversion formulas for accurate analysis.
  3. **Data Consolidation**: Produces a **consolidated CSV file** that allows for easier data processing in environments like **Excel**, and enables the creation of visual plots to analyze the behavior inside the vehicle environment.

- **Key Features**:
   - **Data Merging**: Merges **master and slave data** from different time frames to remove spaces and simplify data analysis.
  - **Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion**: Converts **hexadecimal data** in diagnostics into **decimal format**, with optional conversion formulas for certain values.
  - **CSV File Output**: Generates a **consolidated CSV file** that is compatible with tools like **Excel**, facilitating further analysis.
  - **Data Visualization**: Allows for **plotting** the processed data to analyze the behavior of climatic conditions inside the vehicle.

- **Skills/Technologies Used**:
  - **Programming Language**: Python for data processing and analysis.
  - **Libraries**: 
    - **Pandas** for efficient data manipulation and CSV generation.
    - **NumPy** for numerical data processing.
    - **Matplotlib** for generating visual plots of the processed data.
  - **File Formats**: Works with **CSV files** for data storage and compatibility with other tools.

### Machine Learning Project on Titanic Dataset
- **Description**: Predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. Involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

- **Key Steps**: Preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM), and evaluation using performance metrics.

- **Skills/Technologies**: **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**.
